#README - Tweepgrabber

---

This tool was developed by Matthew Reidsma in HTML, PHP, and Javascript to make conducting research on Twitter followers easier. We hope you find it useful.

While doing research on the difference between perception and reality in University Libraries' Twitter followers, Grand Valley State University Librarians Abby Bedford and Matthew Reidsma needed a quick tool to grab Twitter followers for specific users on one screen. The result is Tweepgrabber. Itâ€™s real power lies in the ability to parse Twitter bios for keywords and automatically code those users into groups. 

INSTALLATION

Open index.php in a text editor (NOT Microsoft Word! Use Notepad if you have nothing else). On line number #37, replace the string "$searches = "...";  with a string of your own keywords you'd like to look for in Twitter bios. The format for this string is as follows: keyword + pipe symbol "|" + code + comma "," + keyword + pipe symbol "|" + code + comma "," etc...

Example:

If I want to code all followers with the words "librarian" and "library" as "4", and I want to code all followers with "undergrad*" as "1", I would use the following syntax: 

$searches = ""librarian|4,library|4,professor|2,undergrad|1";

You don't have to use integers for your code. Strings are just fine.

Now, copy the files to your computer or a Web server and open the "index.php" file. Enter the name of a twitter user and click "Get Followers." You'll see a complete list of these followers, along with bios and codes (if any keywords were present in the bio). Click the "Select All" button and all the data in the table is selected. Hit Ctrl-C (or Cmd-C on a Mac) to copy the data and you can now paste it into your favorite spreadsheet application. (This doesn't really work in Webkit browsers - Safari and Chrome. Try Firefox.)
